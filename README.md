# Learning outcomes

Learn about the syntax of regular expressions, practice working with the string type, parsing, and slicing, and get more familiar with boolean algebra and recursion.

# About

Regular expressions are a fundamental part of computer science and natural language processing. In this project, you will write an extendable regex engine that can handle basic regex syntax, including literals (a, b, c, etc.), wild-cards (.), and metacharacters (?, *, +, ^, $).
